### Milky - the Indent-based Language liKe pYthon

This project aims to create a little language that compiles into C, just as CoffeeScript compiles to JavaScript. The syntax of milky is similar to Python, and it is also inspired by Ruby, CoffeeScript, and so on.

Currently the project is written in Python 3, and later it will be rewritten in milky language when it is powerful enough to bootstrap itself. In future versions, the milky compiler might be able to directly compile milky source into machine code without being converted into C firstly.
