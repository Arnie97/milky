Milky is a little language that compiles into C, just like CoffeeScript compiles into JavaScript. Milky has a clear indent-based syntax similar to Python, and it is also inspired by Ruby, Go, Swift and many other programming languages.

Currently the project is written in C, and later it will be rewritten in milky language when it is ready to bootstrap itself. In the future, a back-end compiler might be done to directly compile milky source into machine code without the help of C compilers.
