<img src="milky.png" alt="Logo of Milky" width="200">

This project aims to create a little language that compiles into C, just as CoffeeScript compiles into JavaScript. The syntax of milky is similar to Python, and it is also inspired by Ruby, CoffeeScript, and many other programming languages.

Currently the project is written in C, and later it will be rewritten in milky language when it is powerful enough to bootstrap itself. In future versions, the milky compiler might be able to directly compile milky source into machine code without being converted into C firstly.
